            prerequest: function (err, cursor, results, item) {
                var result = results[0].result // changed
                // 1. result.masked is removed
                // 2. result.globals now actually holds postman Global VariableScope
                // 3. result.globals.* have now been moved to result.*
            },
            test: function (err, cursor, results, item) {
                var result = results[0].result // changed (see below for changes)
                // 1. result.masked is removed
                // 2. result.globals now actually holds postman Global VariableScope
                // 3. result.globals.* have now been moved to result.*
            }
        });
        
        // v6.x
        run.start({
            prerequest: function (err, cursor, results, item) {
                // results[0].result now has the following structure:
                // {
                //     target: 'prerequest'
                //     environment: <VariableScope>
                //     globals: <VariableScope>
                //     data: <Object of data variables>
                //     return: <contains set next request params, etc>
                // }
            },
            test: function (err, cursor, results, item) {
                // results[0].result now has the following structure:
                // {
                //     target: 'test'
                //     environment: <VariableScope>

                //     data: <Object of data variables>
                //     cookies: <Array of "Cookie">
                //     tests: <Object>
                //     return: <contains set next request params, etc>
                // }
            }
        });
* The deprecated parameters for `legacyRequest` & `legacyResponse` are no longer provided in the `request` event. Instead, the API now provides `cookies`

        // v5.x
        run.start({
            request: function (err, cursor, response, request, item, legacyResponse, legacyRequest) {

        });
        
        // v6.x
        run.start({
            request: function (err, cursor, response, request, item, cookies) {

               certificateManager: myCertManager
           }
        });

        // v5.x
        var runner = new Runner();

        });

        // v5.x
        var runner = new Runner();
        
        runner.run(collection, {
            // Resolves system proxy 
            systemProxy: function (url, callback) {
                return callback(null, new ProxyConfig());
            },

        });

            }   
        });

        // v5.x
        var runner = new Runner();
