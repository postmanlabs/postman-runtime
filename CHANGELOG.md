* :bug: Fixed a bug where the assertions for legacy `tests` failures did not have an `error` object.
* :arrow_up: Updated dependencies

#### v7.0.0 (November 7, 2017)

* [BREAKING] #453 #447 Added default timeout value to 3 min.
    - Timeout options take a positive value in milliseconds. e.g.
        ```javascript
        runner.run(collection, { timeout: {
            global: 5 * 60 * 1000, // total timeout of 5 minutes
            request: 500, // timeout for individual requests
            script: 200 // timeout for individual scripts
        } });
        ```
    - If you are increasing the default timeout for `script`/`request`, make sure `global` timeout is sufficiantly larger than that.
    - Use `0` for no timeout (infinite timeout).

    - The `assertion` callback is now passed with an array of assertions.
    - All assertions, both `pm.test` and legacy `tests` global are now available in the `assertion` callback.
    - The legacy `tests` are no longer available in results parameter in `test` callback.
* [BREAKING] #427 The `entrypoint` option now supports selecting requests as well as folders
    - To execute a folder/request using id or name
    ```javascript
    runner.run(collection, { entrypoint: {
        execute: `${desiredIdOrName}`,
        lookupStrategy: 'idOrName'
    }});
    ```
    - To execute a folder/request using a path
    ```javascript
    runner.run(collection, { entrypoint: {
        execute: `${desiredId}`,
        lookupStrategy: 'path',
        path: ['grand_parent_folder_id', 'parent_folder_id']
    }});
    ```

                var result = results[0].result // changed
                // 1. result.masked is removed
                // 2. result.globals now actually holds postman Global VariableScope
                // 3. result.globals.* have now been moved to result.*
            },
            test: function (err, cursor, results, item) {

                // 1. result.masked is removed

                // 3. result.globals.* have now been moved to result.*
            }
        });

        // v6.x
        run.start({
            prerequest: function (err, cursor, results, item) {
                // results[0].result now has the following structure:

                // }
            },
            test: function (err, cursor, results, item) {
                // results[0].result now has the following structure:
                // {
